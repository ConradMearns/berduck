# Berduck

## The slightly-intelligent rubber duck that helps you think out loud

This is a prototype built for the Interhackt designathon, Dec 2020. 

See [the first day's log](output/2020-12-07.md) for an example of how Berduck can help you debug your code. In this case, I was fine-tuning some of Berduck's code. This is rubber ducking and dogfooding at the same time: possibly a whole new animal.

During that conversation, I explain how Berduck works. You can read it here, or examine the [code](app.py)

Berduck also tags entities, so you can open the output folder in Obsidian and see backlinks waiting for you to elaborate:
