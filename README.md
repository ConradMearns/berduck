# Berduck

## The slightly-intelligent rubber duck that helps you think out loud

This is a prototype built for the Interhackt designathon, Dec 2020. 

Berduck helps you "rubber duck" your problems. Sometimes you just need someone to talk to, and int he process of talking you solve your problem or come up with new ideas. Berrduck helps with that process. You can chat with Berduck and it responds empathetically, with emoji faces and brainstorming questions to help you elaborate on your thoughts. 
It's not very smart, but that's okay: you are. Berduck records all your conversations in human-readable markdown files, so you can always access your previous thoughts.

See [the first day's log](output/2020-12-07.md) for an example of how Berduck can help you debug your code. In this case, I was fine-tuning some of Berduck's code. This is rubber ducking and dogfooding at the same time: possibly a whole new animal.

During that conversation, I explain how Berduck works. You can read it here, or examine the [code](app.py)

Berduck also tags entities, so you can open the output folder in Obsidian and see backlinks waiting for you to elaborate:
