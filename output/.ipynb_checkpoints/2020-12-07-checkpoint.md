I'm working on my project for the [[Interhackt] competition. It's a virtual rubber duck: a little bot that pays attention to what I'm writing and asks questions about it.
----  😶 Who is [[Interhackt]? interhackt... [[QUARLES]?... interhackt... [[POST-IMPRESSIONISM]?...

Lol! [[Interhackt] is a "a week-long online designathon to explore the future of interfaces At least, that's what it says on the website. Well, actually, it says more if you click on various words within that sentence. The words expand to larger versions of what they're meant to represent. I guess that's good if you want more clarification, like if you didn't understnad what "designathon" meant then you could click on it and it says "design hackathon". Useful for accessibility. But as a lover of interfaces, I want to click on everything that it presents and be surprised and delighted by each unfolding bit of text. The factfinitions is kind of annoying though. Like I'm mining through this rich vein of something but it turns out to be fool's gold instead of real gold. Whatever though, it's a cool design choice and it gets the point across: we're doing things *futuristically*!
----  😏 various words... WORDS?... various words... words?... various words... UNPUBLISHED?...

Cute. See, I didn't say the bot asks *good* questions. 
----  [[😛] good* questions... ****?... good* questions... PANELISTS?... good* questions... └?...

You wouldn't know a good question if you saw one, would you buddy? But it's actually pretty hard to ask a good question. The people who work on chatbots learned this long ago: You can hard-code a vague question, the sort of cold-read thing that a conman or a bargain psychic would ask, and people will respond eagerly andcandidly. But once you start trying to extract information programmatically through text, it becomes much harder to seem intelligent. Humans balk when they feel [[the uncanny valley], and asking bad questions is a quick route to that effect.
----  😯 bad questions... qustions?... bad questions... questions?... bad questions... Queried?...

So asking *really bad* questions is actually better than just asking bad ones. After all, a rubber duck doesn't have any uncanny valley effect, because it doesn't seem human. Better to have a silent rubber duck on your desk to talk to, than an idiot robot that backseat-drives. Many of us already have idiot robots micromanaging us, anyway. 
----  😶 idiot robots... NINNIES?... idiot robots... ANDROIDS?... idiot robots... BUFFOON?...

Yes, exactly. [[Android] ninnies. Buffoons.
----  😏 Who is [[Android]? [[android] ninnies... NINNIES?... [[android] ninnies... die-hards?...

Hang on, I've made a little tweak to your code. I'll brb.
----  😶 a little tweak... DINGED?... a little tweak... UPPING?... a little tweak... SLINKED?...

I think I have adjusted your thought processes, little duck. I wanted you to not repeat the same phrase over and over as you reached for nearby thoughts.

----  😳 nearby thoughts... CLOSE-BY?... WENDING?...

Well, i did something wrong and you hung up on me after only one turn. Is that going to happen again?

----  😣 What is only one? Cardinal? only one turn... TOP-20?...

Ah, that's better. One turn, I meant. A conversational turn is like a back-and-forth between you and me. We converse, you then me then you, until I run out of things to talk about and send an empty string to exit. Then you record what we talked about in a Markdown file, tagging all the people and places and things within it to help me keep my knowledge database.

----  😏 things... COMMING?... coming?...

Like I said, dumb questions are better than bad smart questions. Like right now, i can just ignore you. Wht I'm trying to say is that the notes you take will be annotated with [[NER]. THat's named entity recognition. So any kind of proper-noun type things in the document get tagged with [[backlink]] notation, and that will help build a knowledge graph when I open the notes folder in Obsidian or import it into [[Roam].

----  [[😯] bad smart questions... PISSED?... PANELISTS?...

Not sure where you're getting that idea, "panelists". I mean, I know generally how you're getting ideas. It's kind of an interesting method: overly complicated, probably, for how effective it is. Or *isn't*, II guess. 

----  😥 ideas... BRAINSTORM?... DOERS?...

Yeah! Brainstorm is a good description, actually. You analyze the texts I send using [[TextRank] algorithm, which looks for phrases that point at other phrases and extracts the key words that everything else seems to be pointing to. Then you look through those phrases and either ask "who/where/what/how much" questions, if you recognize them as entities, or you brainstorm.

----  [[😯] other phrases... Two-Word?... Regionalisms?...

Two-word phrases, one-word phrases, and actually even three-word phrases are included in [[TextRank]. I'm afraid my previous meddlings have severely restricted your question range, though. I inserted a logic gate totest whether we've already talked about something, to keep your questions from being too repetitive. But now you're really having to reach for anything to talk about. And maybe you're only doing one-word brainstoorms? Let me open up your head real quick and have a look
