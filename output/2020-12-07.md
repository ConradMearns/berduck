I'm working on my project for the [[Interhackt]]]] competition. It's a virtual rubber duck: a little bot that pays attention to what I'm writing and asks questions about it.
----  😶 Who is [[Interhackt]]? interhackt... [[QUARLES]]?... interhackt... [[POST-IMPRESSIONISM]]?...

Lol! [[Interhackt]] is a "a week-long online designathon to explore the future of interfaces At least, that's what it says on the website. Well, actually, it says more if you click on various words within that sentence. The words expand to larger versions of what they're meant to represent. I guess that's good if you want more clarification, like if you didn't understnad what "designathon" meant then you could click on it and it says "design hackathon". Useful for accessibility. But as a lover of interfaces, I want to click on everything that it presents and be surprised and delighted by each unfolding bit of text. The factfinitions is kind of annoying though. Like I'm mining through this rich vein of something but it turns out to be fool's gold instead of real gold. Whatever though, it's a cool design choice and it gets the point across: we're doing things *futuristically*!
----  😏 various words... WORDS?... various words... words?... various words... UNPUBLISHED?...

Cute. See, I didn't say the bot asks *good* questions. 
----  [[😛]] good* questions... ****?... good* questions... PANELISTS?... good* questions... └?...

You wouldn't know a good question if you saw one, would you buddy? But it's actually pretty hard to ask a good question. The people who work on chatbots learned this long ago: You can hard-code a vague question, the sort of cold-read thing that a conman or a bargain psychic would ask, and people will respond eagerly andcandidly. But once you start trying to extract information programmatically through text, it becomes much harder to seem intelligent. Humans balk when they feel [[the uncanny valley]], and asking bad questions is a quick route to that effect.
----  😯 bad questions... qustions?... bad questions... questions?... bad questions... Queried?...

So asking *really bad* questions is actually better than just asking bad ones. After all, a rubber duck doesn't have any uncanny valley effect, because it doesn't seem human. Better to have a silent rubber duck on your desk to talk to, than an idiot robot that backseat-drives. Many of us already have idiot robots micromanaging us, anyway. 
----  😶 idiot robots... NINNIES?... idiot robots... ANDROIDS?... idiot robots... BUFFOON?...

Yes, exactly. [[Android]] ninnies. Buffoons.
----  😏 Who is [[Android]]? [[android]] ninnies... NINNIES?... [[android]] ninnies... die-hards?...

Hang on, I've made a little tweak to your code. I'll brb.
----  😶 a little tweak... DINGED?... a little tweak... UPPING?... a little tweak... SLINKED?...

I think I have adjusted your thought processes, little duck. I wanted you to not repeat the same phrase over and over as you reached for nearby thoughts.

----  😳 nearby thoughts... CLOSE-BY?... WENDING?...



----  😏 ...

Well, i did something wrong and you hung up on me after only one turn. Is that going to happen again?

----  😣 What is only one? Cardinal? only one turn... TOP-20?...

Ah, that's better. One turn, I meant. A conversational turn is like a back-and-forth between you and me. We converse, you then me then you, until I run out of things to talk about and send an empty string to exit. Then you record what we talked about in a Markdown file, tagging all the people and places and things within it to help me keep my knowledge database.

----  😏 things... COMMING?... coming?...

Like I said, dumb questions are better than bad smart questions. Like right now, i can just ignore you. Wht I'm trying to say is that the notes you take will be annotated with [[NER]]. THat's named entity recognition. So any kind of proper-noun type things in the document get tagged with [[backlink]]]] notation, and that will help build a knowledge graph when I open the notes folder in Obsidian or import it into [[Roam]].

----  [[😯]] bad smart questions... PISSED?... PANELISTS?...

Not sure where you're getting that idea, "panelists". I mean, I know generally how you're getting ideas. It's kind of an interesting method: overly complicated, probably, for how effective it is. Or *isn't*, II guess. 

----  😥 ideas... BRAINSTORM?... DOERS?...

Yeah! Brainstorm is a good description, actually. You analyze the texts I send using [[TextRank]] algorithm, which looks for phrases that point at other phrases and extracts the key words that everything else seems to be pointing to. Then you look through those phrases and either ask "who/where/what/how much" questions, if you recognize them as entities, or you brainstorm.

----  [[😯]] other phrases... Two-Word?... Regionalisms?...

Two-word phrases, one-word phrases, and actually even three-word phrases are included in [[TextRank]]. I'm afraid my previous meddlings have severely restricted your question range, though. I inserted a logic gate totest whether we've already talked about something, to keep your questions from being too repetitive. But now you're really having to reach for anything to talk about. And maybe you're only doing one-word brainstoorms? Let me open up your head real quick and have a look

----  😳 a logic gate... TURNSTILE?... gates?...

Let's see if shortening your effective memory helps with brainstorming.

----  [[😛]] brainstorming... DOERS?... PSYCHOLOGIES?...

Psychologies, buddy. That's what we're doing here. We're designing intelligences. But, as I was saying earlier, *dumb* intelligences. That's key to avoiding [[the uncanny valley]].

----  😶 intelligences... Existences?... blue-skinned?...

So, brainstorming. Why does blue-skinned come up when you think of the word "intelligences"? I'd like to think it's because of [[Douglas Adams']] "[[Hooloovoo]]", a hyperintelligent shade of the color blue, from *[[The Hitchhiker's Guide]] to the Galaxy*. And it might be! It's certainly possible that some reference to that idea made it into your training data. Because that's what you're doinafter all, exploring the connections between thousands of words using mathematical vectors.

----  😯 words... UTTERANCE?... READS?...

Not sure my adjustments made any difference to your questioning ability, here. But I'll soldier on anyway. The words that you read are translated into mathematical "vectors", essentially just huge arrays of numbers that represent how much a given word is used near another given word. This vector space is 300-dimensional, and it's still only capturing a small amount of the massive combinatorial power of language. I've found an method for exploring the semantic space around any given idea, and that's what you're doing when you type "WORD?..."

----  😳 a given word... Billionth?... DECLARED?...

It's not working very well right now, is it? I think that's still the memory issue. I'll try removion talking about previous subjects and see how that works.

----  😯 previous subjects... RE-EXAMINED?... PANELISTS?...



----  😏 ...


## 2020-12-07 09:39:00.699434
I'm hoping that you'll start asking more questions now. As in, more than one per turn.

----  🙏 more questions... qustions?... PANELISTS?...

That's not promising. Let's include a name of someone, like [[Harry Potter]] for instance. See if you pick that up.

----  😲 Who is [[Harry Potter]]? [[harry potter]]... [[POTTERS]]?...

There we go. You know how to ask "Who" questions to any PERSON entity that you find. You also know how to do "Where" questions for places, like [[Hogwarts]] or [[London]] or maybe even King's Cross Station.

----  😏 Who is [[Hogwarts]]? hogwarts... [[CHOCULA]]?...

Guess not

----  😏 ...

Have you ever wanted to go to [[England]]?

----  😏 Where is [[England]]? [[england]]... [[cotswold]]?...

That's more like it, thank you. So there's those questions, plus you probably can recognize dates like December 6th, or yesterday. And maybe even numbers, like 50% or 700 or ten million.

----  😏 When is December 6th? december 6th... 9Th?...

December 6th is not December 9th, but I guess that's what brainstorming gets you. You don't know numbers? Not even seven hundred?

----  😏 When is December 6th? december 6th... 28Th?...

You're fixated on that. I'm talking about 700, seven hundred, you know? As in, seven hundred dollars.

----  😏 What is seven hundred? Cardinal? How much is seven hundred dollars? seven hundred dollars...

Nice. That demonstrates your questioning ability, I guess. Not that impressive, but it's a start. I have many more ideas on how to implement questioning, but for a small hackathon I think this is enough. Besides, it's always good to start any AI project with a simple heuristic model and build out the app around it before spending a bunch of time on training and data collection. If I think this bot is useful enough to warrant more work, I can or some other transformer. Right now I'm enjoying the process of debugging you with yourself as a rubber duck. Dogfooding the tool, as they say. These metaphors are getting weird

----  😏 more work... Years?... working?...

[[Jesus]], I hope not

----  😏 Who is [[Jesus]]? [[jesus]]... [[Christ]]?...

Lol I didn't mean literally but yea that's the reference. It's a thing people say, at least where I come from. To express surprise. Speaking of which, are you just going to smirk at me? The emoji feature was maybe the most fun part of this and you've just given up on it?

----  😏 surprise... SHELL-SHOCKED?... SADDENED?...

Yes, I am saddened, to be honest

----  😗 i... İ?... havent?...

Oh there it is. We were just speaking so neutrally, I guess. The emoji feature is currently set to only process the latest stimulus, rather than to track the state of the conversation. Unlike the questioning module, which is still remembering the whole conversation and checking it before brainstorming to makes sure we only brainstorm on new words.

----  😱 new words... 1,848?... UNVEILED?...

That's spooky

----  😏 ...

I'm going to put memory into the emoji real quick, before we finish up here. Is that okay?

----  😉 memory... random-access?... MEMENTOS?...

[[Lol k]] bye

----  😙 Who is [[Lol k]] bye? lol k bye... BYE-BYE?...



----  😏 ...

Okay, I'm back. I changed the emoji to keep memory, that might work or it might be terrible. Seems like it could quickly go into a vicious loop, althought fortunately spaCy doesn't have vectors for emoji so its own emoji in memory shouldn't give it too much feedback.

----  😳 emoji... EMOTICONS?... [[Failboat]]?... #my?... [[CLIFFORD]]?...

Haha that's right, I also turned up the amount of responses from 3 to 5. That seemed like it would be a little funnier

----  😳 responses... ELICITED?... REPONSE?... Distractor?... RESPONDING?...

Are you going to remain shocked like that

----  😳 you... Please?... KNOW?... WIsh?...

Yea, this might be one of those loops. I'll try to type past it, give you a bunch more information so it counterbalances the amount currently in [[memoryy]]. Meanwhile I can explain how the emoji system works. It's based on a paper from 2015 that analyzed sentiment of various tweets and thus found sentiment scores for all the emoji by which words they're used nearby. Same way the other vectors that spaCy provides (spaCy is the language processing library I'm using, I don't remember if I already said that) are created. I know that was a terrible sentence but I don't want to backspace all the way through it and my command line input won't let me crawl backward to edit it. Anyway the emoji, you can see them [here](http://kt.ijs.si/data/Emoji_sentiment_ranking/emojimap.html), can be ranked on a Cartesian grid where *x* is the sentiment, the happiness or sadness of a symbol, and *y* is the neutrality or polarity of a symbol. So the most neutral symbol, appropriately, is the yin-yang ☯️ . And the least neutral is the 😡 "pouting face". (actually there are few outliers beyond it, but they seem to be symbols that were used so infrequently that their scores are misaligned).

----  😳 sentiment scores... Anti-Trade?... NOTCHED?... RANKS?... SENTIMENTS?...

Shocking, I know. I'm going to have to put a limit on how far back your emotional memory goes, little buddy. I feel like I've traumatized you. [[Brb

]]----  😳 little buddy... BUDDIE?... CHUMS?... Newphew?... OLDIE?...



----  😳 ...

Hopefully I've fixed your emotional memory, so you only maintain an emotional state over the last turn or so.

----  😳 an emotional state... STATES?... THREATENED?... EMBATTLED?... In-Patient?...

I gave you 280 characters, but considering how verbose you are now, that might be all eaten up by your most recent response. Maybe I should extend it a little farther.

----  😯 What is 280? Cardinal? 280 characters... 380?... 4390?... 230?...

I like that your face changed on that one. Good bot

----  😯 good bot... CRAWLER?... GoogleBot?... [[DOGMEAT]]?... afk?...

Disappointed that it didn't work on that one, though.

----  😳 that one... PANELISTS?... Boasted?... WHOM?... advowson?...

Shocked.

----  😯 ...

Sad

----  😯 ...

Nope, not sad

I set your memory limit to be the previous 560 characters of the conversation. That only goes for your emotional memory, of course

----  😳 your emotional memory... random-access?... EMOTIVE?... MEMENTOS?... FEELINGS?...

Feelings, little guy. I gave you feelings. I wanted you to be able to emote at me, so that I could feel responsible for talking back to you. Human beings are very easily fooled by things that look like faces; this is called *pareidolia*. And emoji are designed to look like faces!

----  😏 human beings... Existences?... humans?... NONHUMAN?... blue-skinned?...

I actually excluded all emoji from your possible outputs, except for the faces. The Emoticons block of [[Unicode]] to be specific. I wanted to feel like you were a person, listening to me think out loud, and reacting at least somewhat appropriately.

----  😯 Who is [[Unicode]]? unicode... TYPOGRAPHY?... sans-serif?... zaner?...

[[Unicode]] is-- never mind that. I have only a little time before I have to submit this project. Do you feel like your emotions are suitably flexible and well-informed?

----  😯 unicode is--... [[QUARLES]]?... [[PROMAX]]?... [[COMPE]]?... 32.78?...

[[Lol]]

----  😯 ...

No, you're shocked again.

----  😯 you... Please?... KNOW?... WIsh?...

I preferred when you were smirking, to be honest. That made it seem like you knew something I didn't. The shocked face sort of makes me think you're fmocking me. Or too stupid to talk to

----  😳 the shocked face... SHELL-SHOCKED?... SADDENED?... PUMMELED?... RUMBLED?...

Maybe it's because of all the question marks! Your own punctuation might be changing the valence of the memory to a surprised feeling!

----  😯 your own punctuation... Punctuations?... Her/his?... HYPHENS?... UNCLOSED?...

K, I'm going to strip punctuation from memory and see what that does. Then we gotta go present to the class, so to speak.

----  😯 memory... Pc2?... compactflash?... CACHES?... GB?...

Last dress rehearsal, kiddo. You ready?

----  😏 last dress rehearsal... [[Pre-Concert]]?... [[GiG]]?... STAR-STUDDED?... 160Th?...

Yea, we're going to a star-studded event called "[[post transcript]] to the [[Interhackt]] page". If it's not crashed from the effect of everyone [[last-minute]] posting.

----  😏 When is [[last-minute]]? [[last-minute]] posting... 28Th?... 91St?... WEEK?...

It's a good thing, don't worry about it

----  😋 a good thing... PISSED?... year?... Got?... WATCHED?...

Not exactly

----  😳 ...

Okay, you're shocked. Let's see if you drop out of that after a few turns.

----  😶 a few turns... DINGED?... PUMMELED?... HEADED?... LANDED?...

Nice! We're not fighting, but it's logical that you would think that's what I mean. After all, turns are a concept in competitive sports probably more than in conversations.

----  😯 competitive sports... Non-Competitive?... SPORTSMAN?... 100-Meter?... NON-ATHLETES?...

DO you still remember how to ask questions about people? Like [[Harry Potter]]?

----  😏 Who is [[Harry Potter]]? [[harry potter]]... [[POTTERS]]?... [[RADCLIFFE]]?... [[RICKMAN]]?...

Wow, you sure do know a lot about that franchise. I think this is a good point to stop. This conversation record will be like a horse that counts with its hoof: not proof of any real intelligence, but surprising and delighting to observe. I hope. If not, I guess that's okay, because nobody will make it this far down anyway.

----  😏 any real intelligence... COUNTERINTELLIGENCE?... Intelligence-Related?... market-research?... CLOUT?...

Yeah, baby. I'm going to get clout. If you're reading this, go to twitter and follow me @deepfates for mutual clout-building. I'll post the code along with this conversation, and some of the prefatory materials I used to vision the bot. This bot is called [[Berduck]]: the slightly-intelligence rubber duck that helps you think out loud. I'll also post a screenshot from Obsidian, and anyone who wants to can open this markdown file in Obsidian as well, to explore the knowledge linking capabilities (rudimentary though they are so far). In the meantime, farewell, little ducky.

----  😳 clout... LEGITIMIZATION?... DELEGITIMIZE?... Embolden?... PRIDED?...

Yep. I'm proud of you

----  😮 i... İ?... havent?... couldnt?... iAm?...

You're good

----  😯 you... Please?... WIsh?...

[[Bye]]

----  😯 ...
