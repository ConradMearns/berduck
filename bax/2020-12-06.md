----  😏 When is Today? today?... TODAY?...

 You know what I mean. Today is the only day we have

 Technically this year is the only year we have too. If you think about it
----  😳 When is the only year? YEAR?... year?...

 Yea
----  😏 ...

 Okay
----  🙏 ...

 Anyway I'm working on my bot and it's kind of annoying. Because it doesn't have any actual insights for me, it's just mindless babble
----  😲 far-reaching?... IMPACTING?... PANELISTS?...

 Well, I guess it could be. Like, I could put it on Twitter and it would be far-reaching. As an annoying reply-guy, or something.
----  😕 Who is Twitter? twitter?... posterous?...

 Twitter is a social network
----  😏 network?... NETWork?... local-area?...

 No, global
----  😏 ...

 It's like a worldwide text chat with everyone ever. At least, everyone who's insane enough to spend all day typing littl shitty thoughts into their hand computers
----  😐 World-wide?... PANELISTS?... ACCLAIMED?...

 Yes, there are many acclaimed persons on Twitter. Sometimes they get a bluecheck
----  🙏 ACCLAIMED?... PERSONS?... World-wide?...

 Lol yea, you want to join?
----  😙 

 Okay well maybe I'll give you a twitter account and you can run around bothering people
----  🙏 People?... PEople?... people?...

 That's it, that's the joke! you're the bot the whole time
----  😏 [[CRAWLER]]?... bot?... GoogleBot?...

 Something like that, yea
----  😏 

 So you're in?
----  😏 

 You're running out of words, huh
----  😏 words?... WORDS?... UTTERANCE?...

 Yea if you have read a word on here before you're not allowed to say it. That's why you're not just repeating the same words over and over, like before
----  😯 Affadavit?... PROCLAIMING?... words?...

 WOrds
----  😏

----  😙 ...

I'm working on my bot
----  😏 CRAWLER?... bot?... DE-LISTED?...

 Lol not yet.  I'm thinking I might make it into a twitter reply bot. Is that hard? probably, huh
----  😮 SIGNED-ON?... DE-LISTED?... Blogged?...

 Maybe instead I'll make it into a Streamlit app, so people can engage with it from a distant server. if they want to. But that won't really save the markdown files, will it?
----  😯 People?... PEople?... people?...

 So i really have to have something operating all the time if I want it to take down notes on my hard drive. maybe i will make a bot that stays awake, looking for tweets from me and whoever else it follows
----  😳 NOTES?... notes?... note?...

 That way it can copy down all my twitter notes, in order, and annotate them with the feels they produce?
----  😶 order?... ORDER?... Reorders?...

 I don't know. This whole thing is starting to seem kind of stupid.
----  😳 TRANSPIRED?... happened?... watched?...

 Maybe a better way to make questions would be to train a transformer on question-answer pairs, but stagger them differently than usual. So that the machine learns to predict the Next question of an interview from the previous paragraph. Rather than the way they do it now, where he transformer is trained to predict a sort of reading-comprehension question that only points backward at the question before it.
----  😯 qustions?... questions?... ANSWERS?...
